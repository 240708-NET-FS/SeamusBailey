The requirements for this project are:
    1. The application should be a C# Console Application
    2. The application should build and run
    3. The application should interact with users, and provide some console UI
    4. The application should demonstrate some input validation
    5. The application should have unit tests
    6. The application should persist data to a SQL Server database
    7. The application should communicate to DB via EF Core (Entity Framework Core)

Ideas include something to track Bank info. Maybe a lemonade stand business thing, maybe the art spreadsheet I've been using, then I could implement times.
