The requirements for this project are:
    1. The application should be a C# Console Application
    2. The application should build and run
    3. The application should interact with users, and provide some console UI
    4. The application should demonstrate some input validation
    5. The application should have unit tests
    6. The application should persist data to a SQL Server database
    7. The application should communicate to DB via EF Core (Entity Framework Core)

Ideas include something to track Bank info. Maybe a lemonade stand business thing, maybe the art spreadsheet I've been using, then I could implement times.
Kung said we can make it as ridiculous as we want because the trainer's have seen a ton of banking apps.
Basically we just want to be able to enable CRUD

CRUD is Create, Read, Update, Delete. So for just about each entity we make, we need to be able to create, read, update, and delete those entities.
